# React Starter Kit Plus

## Introduction

This is a fork of the official React Starter Kit branch with extra boilerplate specific to my own needs.

## Plus Features

- The user `name` is replaced with `username` and has character constraints for safety. The username must be between 3 - 20 characters long and only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
- Users can log in via email or username.
- More consistent wording for UI labels and messages.
- Improved responsiveness for some shadcn/ui components.
- Disabled shadcn/ui sidebar shortcut.

## More Information

# React Starter Kit Plus

## Introduction

This is a fork of the official React Starter Kit branch with extra boilerplate specific to my own needs.

## Plus Features

- User `name` fields replaced with `username` fields with character constraints for safety. The username must be between 3 - 20 characters long and only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.

## More Information

See the original [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/react-starter-kit) repository.

Documentation for official Laravel starter kits can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits).

## License

Just like the original React starter kit, this is open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license.
